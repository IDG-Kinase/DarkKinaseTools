#' DarkKinaseTools: A package for working with dark kinase data.
#'
#' The DarkKinaseTools package provides three data sets that I've found to be
#' generally usefull for dealing with kinase data sets. These include a set of
#' all human kinase, all dark human kinases and a set of mouse kinases and
#' corresponding human kinases.
